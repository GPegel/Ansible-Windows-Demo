# Ansible-Windows-Demo
A show-off for using Ansible to deploy Windows based machines

# What's needed to make this playbook work?
Install and configure CygWin following this tutorial: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41560/how-to-get-ssh-command-line-access-to-windows-7-using-cygwin/

# Current status?
I've configured CygWin on a virtual Windows 10 and I'm able to connect from my virtual Ubuntu machine to my virtual Windows 10 machine via SSH.

It's important to follow the directions in the tutorial to make this thing work as long as Microsoft has not implemented SSH as a standard service in Windows OS.
